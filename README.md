# SOURCE-CODE-COMPILER (A mini convertor tool)
I tried to make a convertor tool that converts all programming languages in the same terminal. 


#### Description:
I made a project on mini convertor tool for LINUX operating system. There are different kinds of terminal for different programming languages. It is a wasting of time to use different software for different programming language. I thought how to stop wasting time by not using different kinds of software. Every programming language syntax are different to each other for this reason we can’t use same software for another programming language. Every programming language needs individual Terminal to run.  
By using this terminal we can easily run every programming language’s source code from our directory. I decided to name my project “SOURCE CODE COMPILER”.


#### Features and algorithm:
Here I use Python2, Python3, C, C++, Java programming language as example and use LINUX as operating system.

#### Challenges faced: 
1)	Syntax problem.
